/* ============================================================
   COURSE CONFIG — single source of truth for all four courses.
   Edit values HERE and every course page picks them up.
   No other file needs to change term-to-term.

   For each course:
     meet          — the class Google Meet link
     sheetId       — Google Sheet ID (URL part between /d/ and /edit)
     sheetGid      — the tab's gid (the number after gid= in the URL)
     exam          — countdown card { name, date (ISO), from (year start) }
                     set exam: null for courses with no countdown card
     syllabusDocId — Google Doc ID for the syllabus (URL part between
                     /document/d/ and /edit). Drives the syllabus page.

     resourceCards — the cards in the RIGHT column of the home page.
                     An ARRAY of cards; each card is:
                       { title: "CARD NAME",
                         items: [
                           { name:"Shown in bold",
                             desc:"Small grey line under it (optional)",
                             url:"https://...",
                             icon:"shield" }        // optional, see below
                         ] }
                     • To ADD a resource: add an item to a card's items.
                     • To ADD a whole new card: add a new { title, items }.
                     • To REMOVE one: delete its line/block.
                     icon options: shield · graph · flag · video · book ·
                     exam · code · classroom · doc · diamond · bitcoin · link
                     (omit icon to use the default link icon)

   The Sheet AND the Doc must be shared: "Anyone with the link -> Viewer".
